                            <p>France seduces travellers with its unfalteringly familiar culture, woven around cafe terraces, village-square markets and lace-curtained bistros with their plat du jour (dish of the day) chalked on the board.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>One of top attractions in France is Eiffel Tower. There are different ways to experience the Eiffel Tower, from a daytime trip or an evening ascent amid twinkling lights, to a meal in one of its restaurants. And even though some seven million people come annually, few would dispute that each visit is unique – and something that simply has to be done when in Paris.</p>

                            <h3>Iceland</h3>
                            <p>Famous for remote, scenic spots, the Westfjords make for an unforgetable getaway.. Untouched by mass tourism, the area looks like it’s trying to escape, its clutch of finger-like fjords reaching out towards Greenland. Explore quaint villages, spectacular landscapes, epic Icelandic history and an abundance of wildlife.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Don't for a minute think it's all about the great outdoors. The counterpoint to so much natural beauty is found in Iceland's cultural life, which celebrates a literary legacy that stretches from medieval sagas to contemporary thrillers by way of Nobel Prize winners. Live music is everywhere, as is visual art, handicrafts and locavore cuisine.</p>

                            <p>Japan is truly timeless, a place where ancient traditions are fused with modern life as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Wherever you are in Japan, it seems, you're never far from a great meal. Restaurants often specialise in just one dish – perhaps having spent generations perfecting it – and pay close attention to every stage, from sourcing the freshest, local ingredients to assembling the dish attractively. And as you'll quickly discover, Japanese cuisine has great regional variations.</p>
